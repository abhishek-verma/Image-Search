# Image-Search
Kotlin Based Android Application to Search Images from Google Custom Search API

Took this opportunity to explore Kotlin in Android Development and Android Jetpack components like ViewModel, LiveData etc.
Experimented with MVVM Pattern instead on MVC that I usually follow.

TODO:
- Implement Data Binding in Detail Activity
- Handle Item Clicks in ViewModel in Search Result Activity
