# Image-Search
Kotlin Based Android Application to Search Images from Google Custom Search API

Took this opportunity to explore Kotlin in Android Development and Android Jetpack components like ViewModel, LiveData, Paging etc.
Experimented with MVVM Pattern instead on MVP that I usually follow.

TODO:
- Implement Data Binding Jetpack component in Detail Activity
- Handle Item Clicks in ViewModel in Search Result Activity
